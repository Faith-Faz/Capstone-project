## Dataset Content
* The title of this dataset is Online Retail Transactions. This data includes the habits of customers purchasing from a online rertailer. Which includes their country,products and the quantity they brought.

## Business Requirements
* My goal is to clearly show the purchasing trends/patterns that are being made from each country and to identify the most popular product. Which will help an audience understand overall how much is being spent per region. Also answering the question of what product and country bring in the most profit.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* Does every country have the same amount of sales?
* Does the unit price efect the quantiy of products being brought?
* What is the most popular pruduct beign sold overall?

* To validate this I will be ussign an array of analysis techniques and data visualisations.
  * This includes data visualistions created using Matplotlib,Seaborn and Plotly.
 

## Project Plan
* This project was completed using a Kanban board which broke down the following steps:
Extraction 
Tranformation
Loading 
* That included an opitmal work order which ensured the completion of set targets.

## Analysis techniques used
* My project relies heavy on the descriptive analysis technique
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
   My dataset limited me with how big it was in its raw form (541909 rows x 8 cols). So so the alternative approch I had to take was to analyse sample size data for each hypothesis
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?   
  I used generative AI to help with the clarity of my visuals, for instance aiding my decision of currating a bar chart over a line chart. As I had to make sure my findings could be understood by an audience. It also helped with my workflow as I had a mental block, so it helped provide steps and ways to explain my hypothesis.

## Ethical considerations
* There were no legal or sociatal issues with my dataset.


## Development Roadmap
* I faced quite a few challenges on the front end of this project that stunted me timewise. I got past this by going back through the LMS and using external sources such as StackOverflow and the Python.org page to get a more concrete understanding.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Numpy
* Pandas

* I want to thank Vasi, Mark and Niel. As they helped teach me the skills that has made me able to complete the project.
